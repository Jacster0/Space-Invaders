How to play: 

You are playing as the defender and your goal is to shoot down every invader before they hit the ground. 
You can move the defender left and right by using the arrow keys or the a and d key. 
You shoot by pressing space. 

The invaders can, and will shoot back. You have three lives. 

If the invaders either hit the ground or kill you, it's game over.

You can press the R key any time during the game, and it will then reset the high score to zero the next round. 

The point system:

There are three levels of Invaders.
The first two rows are made up of Level1 invaders, 
the second two rows are made up of Level2 invaders and the last row is made up of Level3 invaders.

Level1 = 10pts on hit
Level2 = 20pts on hit
Level3 = 30pts on hit

If you manage to hit any invader that is completely blocked by other invaders (e.g you hit an invader in the middle)
you will get the double amount of points offered by that invader.
