In order to run the Space Invaders project you need: C++20, SDL2, SDL_TTF and SDL_Image
All the textures used in the game are made by me using GIMP.

What did you learn?
I learned a lot more of how I can use the SDL2 library to create games.
I learned to use a sine function to get a nice upscaling/downscaling of the starfield that is rendered in the background.


What was difficult in the lab?
Calculating the Collision detection method. I wasn't sure how I would implement it in just one or few iterations.
Getting the sine function to work properly.

I used Visual Studio 2019.
I probably spent at least 30 hours, maybe more.
