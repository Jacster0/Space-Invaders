# Space-Invaders

A space invaders clone that I made using C++ and SDL2.\
I did intentionally not use the most advanced C++ features since this game was made during a beginner C++ University course. \
The code is kinda messy but feel free to take a look if you want to create your own Space Invaders game. \
There is also an exception safe doubly linked list hiding in this repository.
